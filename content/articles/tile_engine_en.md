<p>It is a 'engine' (if it can be called that way, it's a very small code) for tile games, running in the browser, supporting scrolling and dynamic changes. It doesn't use Flash, it uses HTML5, so it probably works in Androd and iPad/iPod. It can be used to create top-down view RPGs, platformers, tower defense games, etc.</p>
<p>To test the scrolling, <strong>click the frame and use the WASD keys</strong> to move the map. A sample tile change (random in this case) is shown.</p>
