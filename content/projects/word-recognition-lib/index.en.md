title: "Lightweight speech recognition library for EDU-CIAA"
summary: "Lightweight library for speech recognition in ARM Cortex M4 microcontrollers. It extracts MFCC coefficients and recognises words using Viterbi algorithm, and Hidden Markov Chains (HMM), first-order, using gaussian mixture probabilities."

Lightweight library for speech recognition.

The main idea is to add the ability to recognise isolated words to an existing embedded application. By implementing just the needed modules, and optimizing the code, low error rate and low resource usage is achieved.
