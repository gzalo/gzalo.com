This is a basic website that can display your heart rate from a Mi Band 6 smartwatch in a browser window. Basically it's an improvement over miband-5-heart-rate-monitor, modified so it supports the version 6 of the watch (it contains a totally different authentication flow over BLE).

Uses [my own WASM port](https://github.com/gzalo/tiny-ECDH-wasm) of the [tiny-ECDH-c](https://github.com/kokke/tiny-ECDH-c) library to implement the new auth method (that uses Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman - ECDH).
