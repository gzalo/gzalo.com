It is a minimalistic tile engine created in 2011 (it's very small and simple code) for tile games, running in the browser, supporting scrolling and dynamic changes. It doesn't use Flash, it uses HTML5, so it works in Android and on an iPad/iPod. It can be used to create top-down view RPGs, platformers, tower defense games, etc.

To test the scrolling, **click the frame and use the WASD keys** to move the map. A sample tile change (random in this case) is shown.
