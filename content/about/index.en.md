My name is __Gonzalo Avila Alterach__, I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

_Gzalo_ (formerly _gzaloprgm_) is my nickname, I use it as an username in most of my public social media accounts. And it's also the name of my website, this kind of blog that I've been maintaining since almost 20 years ago, in which I post articles and different projects I've built.

I'm an Electronics Engineer, graduated from the Faculty of Engineering of the UBA (_FIUBA_) in 2017. This page and the different videos I publish are a way of sharing everything I learn and continue to learn on a daily basis, in the hopes that someone can find it and make the most out of it.

I consider that in the modern day we have many _paywalls_ that don't let us access the knowledge, and they difficult the advancement of humanity, so most of my personal projects are released under open licenses (even for commercial usage).

[I use GitHub Projects to track the progress of most of my personal projects, you can look at them here](https://github.com/gzalo?tab=projects).

Right now I'm working in _Roche_ as a Software engineer (specialized in backend), the opinions expressed here and in my social accounds are mine, and may not represent the position of my employer.
