My name is __Gonzalo Avila Alterach__, I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

_Gzalo_ (formerly _gzaloprgm_) is my nickname, I use it as an username in most of my public social media accounts. And it's also the name of my website, this kind of blog that I've been maintaining for more than 20 years, in which I post articles and different projects I've built.

I'm an Electronics Engineer, graduated from the Faculty of Engineering of the UBA (_FIUBA_) in 2017. This page and the different videos I publish are a way of sharing everything I learn and continue to learn on a daily basis, in the hopes that someone can find it and make the most out of it.

I consider that nowadays we have many _paywalls_ that don't let us access the knowledge, so most of my projects are released under open licenses (in most cases even for commercial usage).

Right now I'm working for _Roche_ as a Software Architect, the opinions expressed here and in my social accounds are mine, and may not represent the position of my employer.

My ham radio license is _LU6CGA_ (I took the course in March 2025, at [LU4BB / Buenos Aires Radio Club](https://lu4bb.com/) ). I'm also interested in everything related to [Meshtastic and other experimental decentralized networks]((https://github.com/Meshtastic-Argentina).

I'm part of [cybercirujas](https://cybercirujas.rebelion.digital/), a collective against _planned obsolescense_, and in favour of freedom of information and right to repair. We primarily receive donations of computer parts that are considered obsolete, refurbish them, install open-source software, and donate them to those in need.

## Interests
 
- Embedded systems, any number of bits
- Reusing equipment considered obsolete, getting Doom running everywhere
- Robotics, distributed systems and signal processing
