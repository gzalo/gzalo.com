<p>cs_electronicaort is a map for the computer game Counter-Strike 1.6, loosely based in the Electronics floor of ORT Yatay Highscool.</p><p>It was done during december of 2008, designed by me (Gonzalo Ávila) and textured by Gastón Kirsman. It was done using Valve Hammer Editor. If you are interested in creating a derivative or similar map and need the sources, send me an email and I'll probably give them to you.</p>
<p>The map has certain secret tunnels that connect the diferent bases, to make the game more entertaining. In the roof you can find a house with ammo, but to enter you have to know the code.</p>
<p>To install, just copy the .bsp file to the cstrike/maps folder, inside the install folder of the game..</p>
